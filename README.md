# Chrome-Tab-Organizer

Currently, Chrome offers a built-in feature for grouping tabs, allowing users to organize them manually, assign names, and assign colours. However, in this task, you will be creating a Chrome Extension that automates this process, making tab management more efficient.

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

Create a Chrome Extension that automatically groups tabs from the same website under a single bar. Ensure that the extension recognizes the context by naming the bar after the visited website or page automatically.
Implement a feature to assign colours to tabs that match the theme of the respective websites for visual organization.
